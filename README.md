# Photosphere-Viewer
Easily display your photsphere images on the web as taken from Google maps or other software.

## Impliment
This uses Three.js WebGL library to project a sphere using your image as the inner texture, and Orbit controls to move around the image.

## Testing
Your web browser may not allow you to open this directly from your filesystem, if you have Python then use pip to install SimpleHTTPServer then run it within same directory of index.html.

pip install SimpleHTTPServer
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
